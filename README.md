## Introduction
I have been working on this project for 2 days a week during 17 weeks. During this time the needed research has been done 
to be able to make a great product that is suitable for the new building. The following visualisations are the result of 
trying a lot of different things and selecting the best results. 

## Different concepts
In the end a selection of 3 differernt interactive visualisations are presented to the stakeholder. 
#### Schader interaction
This visualisation uses GLSL shaders that van be influenced using your hand and the Leap Motion sensor. when explained simplified, the
height of your hand influences the zoom and the location of your hand influences the movement in the shaders.
#### Particle interaction
This visualisation needs some sort of trigger to start generating particles, these particles will move based on the motion
that is being detected with the webcam. The particles move in different ways and will be generated in different colors and locations
#### Live pixelsorting
This visualisation uses a technology called pixelsorting. You have to options to choose different ways to apply the pixelsorting
on the choosen image. When you have found settings you like you have the option to use a live image taken by your webcam camera. 

## Installation and usage
All the visualisation are based on P5.js and made to work in a webbrowser. Each of the visualisations contains a index.html file
or an different named file that simply can be opende in a webbrowser. All the other files you need to use the visualisation, like
libraries are included. Every visualisation contains a README when more information is needed.
