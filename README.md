## Introduction
I have been working on this project for 2 days a week during 17 weeks. During this time the needed research has been done 
to be able to make a great product that is suitable for the new building. The following visualisations are the result of 
trying a lot of different things and selecting the best results. 

## Different concepts
In the end a selection of 3 differernt interactive visualisations are presented to the stakeholder. 
#### Schader interaction
#### Particle interaction
#### Live pixelsorting

## Installation and usage
All the visualisation are based on P5.js and made to work in a webbrowser. Each of the visualisations contains a index.html file
or an different named file that simply can be opende in a webbrowser. All the other files you need to use the visualisation, like
libraries are included. Every visualisation contains a README when more information is needed.
